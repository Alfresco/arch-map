### Purpose
Explain the primary design goals here; for example, a little bit of history about why the component was created and how it interacts with the Alfresco core product.

*** 

### Overview 
What it does, how it is structured.  Are AMPs or JARs needed to enable the component? Bullet points work well in this section.
*** 

### Artifacts and Guidance

* Source Code Link
* License
* Issue Tracker Link
* Documentation Link
* Contribution Model (describe who can change the code and how the contribution process works).   e.g. Aikau: Enhancements should be submitted as pull requests to GitHub. Ideas and suggestions can be raised as issues in the issue tracker.

*** 


### Prerequisite Knowledge
This might be knowledge of certain software, technologies or other components in Alfresco.
Add any training courses or links to background docs at docs.alfresco.com.
Bullet points work well in this section.

### Design

#### Component Model

#### Data Model
n image is good here (use the PlantUML tooling) with an explanation of the elements of the model.  You can add a sub heading for each element.
#### Data Dictionary
Explain how the Alfresco data dictionary is extended as a result of this component. Explain any new types or aspects that it introduces.
#### Flows
This is where PlantUML comes into its own.  Add your diagram and explain your user flows.
#### Class Diagram
This is where PlantUML comes into its own.  Add your diagram and explain your method and class relationships.
*** 

### APIs and Interfaces
Explain any APIs that are provided as part of the component. How are these built and configured? Are there any related services?
What new interfaces does this component add to Alfresco? 
*** 

### Configuration
You only need this section if there is complex configuration information you've not already included.  You can link to docs.alfresco.com if appropriate.
*** 

### Performance Considerations
Explain caching considerations and anything else that affects Alfresco performance.
*** 

### Security Considerations
What does this component use or implement from a security perspective?  Are access privileges enforced?
*** 

### Cloud Considerations
Is this component deployed to Cloud?  Are there considerations with its implementation?
his component deployed to Cloud?  Are there considerations with its implementation?

| Decision        | Rationale                  | Date         |

| decision 1      | why                        | 01 Jan, 2016 |


### Quiz

You can provide a link to an online quiz where the respondent is asked questions to assess how well they have understood the material.
It is easy to create a quiz using a service that Alfresco already has a license to use.  If you are interested in providing a quiz, contact Greg Melahn to obtain access to the testing service we use.
